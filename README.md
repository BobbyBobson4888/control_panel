# control_panel

i keep making things that require a control panel of some sort. a normal person would just put in the effort to figure out tkinter. a cyber-genius would make a web server embedded in the software that exposes itself to localhost.

this css file doesn't have anything to do with that, it just makes the frontend part of that whole equation a lot quicker.

All you need for this to work is control_panel.css. the index files are for github pages.
